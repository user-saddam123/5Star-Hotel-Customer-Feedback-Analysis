# 5Star-Hotel-Customer-Feedback-Analysis
I embarked on a comprehensive analysis of customer feedback for a five-star hotel. This analysis is designed to uncover vital insights and make recommendations to enhance the guest experience.

Hi LinkedIn Family, I'm thrilled to share the results of my deep dive into customer feedback at a five-star hotel. Using KPIs and visual charts, I found invaluable insights and key recommendations. We collected feedback from 1948 unique guests, resulting in a solid 3.60 overall rating and an impressive NPS(net Promoter score)of 9.75.

✔Here's what I discovered:

◾Gender distribution: 56.26% men and 43.74% women shared their thoughts.

◾Ratings were mostly "Very Good," followed by "Excellent," "Good," "Average," and "Poor."

◾For NPS, I divided guests into Promoters (NPS over 8), Passives (NPS 7-8), and Detractors (NPS below 7).



✔Source Trend Analysis: In this analysis, I have explored the sources from which feedback was collected and delved into the specifics of each source. This breakdown offers a comprehensive view of guest feedback origins.



✔Feedback Category Analysis: My analysis extends to categorizing feedback and aligning it with the overall rating. This provides a detailed understanding of guests' sentiments, allowing for targeted improvements.



✔Rating Trends: I've captured the performance of the hotel over time through a line chart, analyzing total ratings by month. This visualization helps identify trends and make data-driven decisions.



✨Recommendations for enhancing customer satisfaction:

✔Focus on Restaurant Enhancements: Based on the analysis, it's clear that the restaurant experience needs attention. Here are some recommendations:

◾Diversify the menu to cater to different tastes and dietary preferences.

◾Train the staff for exceptional service and menu knowledge.

◾Consider themed dining nights or special promotions to attract guests.

✔Facility Improvements: After addressing the restaurant, it's crucial to work on overall facility enhancements:

◾Regularly maintain and upgrade the hotel's physical infrastructure and aesthetics.

◾Invest in modern technology and amenities to stay competitive.

◾Pay attention to cleanliness and tidiness throughout the premises.

✔Focus on restaurant service improvement . This is the most common area for improvement, according to the customer feedback analysis.

✔Guest-Centric Approach: Always put the guest first:

◾Listen to their needs and preferences to create a personalized experience.

◾Provide options for customization, such as room preferences or special requests.

✔Online Reputation Management: Maintain a strong online presence and reputation:

◾Encourage satisfied guests to leave positive reviews.

I am confident that by taking these steps, the hotel can improve its customer satisfaction and loyalty. This will lead to increased business and revenue.

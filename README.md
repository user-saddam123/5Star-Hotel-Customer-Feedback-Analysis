### Overview
I'm thrilled to share the results of my deep dive into customer feedback at a five-star hotel. Using KPIs and visual charts, I found invaluable insights and key recommendations. We collected feedback from 1948 unique guests, resulting in a solid 3.60 overall rating and an impressive NPS(net Promoter score)of 9.75.

### Insight and finding
 - Gender distribution: 56.26% men and 43.74% women shared their thoughts.
 - Ratings were mostly "Very Good," followed by "Excellent," "Good," "Average," and "Poor."
 - For NPS, I divided guests into Promoters (NPS over 8), Passives (NPS 7-8), and Detractors (NPS below 7).

#

### Source Trend Analysis:
In this analysis, I have explored the sources from which feedback was collected and delved into the specifics of each source. This breakdown offers a comprehensive view of guest feedback origins.

#

### Feedback Category Analysis
My analysis extends to categorizing feedback and aligning it with the overall rating. This provides a detailed understanding of guests' sentiments, allowing for targeted improvements.

#

### Rating Trends:
 I've captured the performance of the hotel over time through a line chart, analyzing total ratings by month. This visualization helps identify trends and make data-driven decisions.

### Recommendations for enhancing customer satisfaction:

1. Focus on Restaurant Enhancements
Based on the analysis, it's clear that the restaurant experience needs attention. Here are some recommendations:
 - Diversify the menu to cater to different tastes and dietary preferences.
 - Train the staff for exceptional service and menu knowledge.
 - Consider themed dining nights or special promotions to attract guests.

2.Facility Improvements: 
After addressing the restaurant, it's crucial to work on overall facility enhancements:
 - Regularly maintain and upgrade the hotel's physical infrastructure and aesthetics.
 - Invest in modern technology and amenities to stay competitive.
 - Pay attention to cleanliness and tidiness throughout the premises.

#
3. Focus on restaurant service improvement . This is the most common area for improvement, according to the customer feedback analysis.
#

4. Guest-Centric Approach: Always put the guest first:
 - Listen to their needs and preferences to create a personalized experience.
 - Provide options for customization, such as room preferences or special requests.

#
5. Online Reputation Management: Maintain a strong online presence and reputation:

 - Respond to negative reviews professionally, showing a commitment to addressing concerns.

#

I am confident that by taking these steps, the hotel can improve its customer satisfaction and loyalty. This will lead to increased business and revenue.
